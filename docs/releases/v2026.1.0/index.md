## Major Changes

AW-SDX 2026.1.0 is a coordinated software release of the AtlanticWave-SDX platform that brings together the core components used for multi-domain topology exchange and point-to-point L2VPN services across heterogeneous controller environments. The release focuses on consistent use of the SDX Topology Data Model, continued support for both versioned and legacy service APIs, and improved stability in topology handling, error processing, and control-plane messaging. Alongside the SDX Controller, SDX Local Controller (SDX-LC), Kytos-SDX, OESS-SDX, and the Path Computation Engine (PCE), this release includes SDX-MEICAN, a web-based management environment for Dynamic Circuit Networks (DCNs) that allows users to request time-bounded circuits between defined endpoints, supports NSI-based inter-domain coordination, and applies operator-defined workflows for provisioning and approval. The release also includes the SDX OXP Integrator, which supports mediation and interoperability at exchange points between participating controller domains. All release artifacts are built and published through automated GitHub Actions workflows.

## Packages and Components

### SDX Controller

- Supports versioned L2VPN service lifecycle APIs, including `/l2vpn/1.0` and legacy `/v1/l2vpn_ptp`.
- Enhanced error handling, including protection against non-JSON responses.
- Improved RabbitMQ-based control-plane messaging robustness.
- Non-blocking topology initialization.

### Path Computation Engine (PCE)

- Constrained shortest-path computation and domain-aware path breakdowns.
- Refactored PCE logic with improved modularity and deployability.
- CI linting, formatting, and coverage improvements.

### SDX Local Controller (SDX-LC)

- Domain-facing endpoints for controller integrations and orchestration.
- Improved exception handling in LC message processing.
- Updated controller API usage when placing connections.
- Correct topology return handling.

### Data Models and APIs

- Official SDX Topology Data Model.
- SDX Port and SDX Link abstractions.
- Improved MongoDB document consistency.
- Topology parsing, validation, and exchange utilities.

### SDX OXP Integrator

- Mediation between SDX and exchange controllers.
- Interoperability across controller platforms.
- Topology information exchange.
- Service coordination at exchange points.

### SDX-MEICAN

- Web-based management for Dynamic Circuit Networks.
- User requests for time-bounded circuits.
- Endpoint and bandwidth specification.
- Policy-based provisioning workflows.
- Integrated circuit monitoring.

### Kytos-SDX NApp

- Topology export from Kytos-ng to SDX-LC using the official Topology Data Model.
- Point-to-point L2VPN provisioning (MEF EVCs) via SDX-LC.
- New and legacy L2VPN APIs retained for compatibility.
- SDX Port/Link modeling with rich metadata.
- Support for `sdx_vlan_range` and `sdx_nni` metadata.
- CI workflows, coverage reporting, and unit tests.

### OESS-SDX

- Integration of AW-SDX capabilities into OESS-MPLS environments.
- Topology export to SDX-LC using the official Topology Data Model.
- L2VPN provisioning via SDX-LC with legacy compatibility.
- VLAN range and NNI metadata support.

### Messaging and Telemetry (RabbitMQ / BAPM)

- RabbitMQ-based messaging for SDX control-plane communications.
- Improved consumer robustness and error handling.
- Telemetry and BAPM integration points.

## Future Enhancements (Non-Claims)

- Additional service models beyond point-to-point L2VPN.
- Expanded measurement and telemetry workflows.
- Further scalability optimizations for large-scale TE requests.
- Continued improvements to testing and deployment automation.
